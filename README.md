# PokeDex-API
An app that will search for Pokémon by name or ID and display the results to the user. Pokémon data and images, obtained using freeCodeCamp's free PokéAPI Proxy. This project is the final certification project in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Data Structured and Algorithms course. 

The application fetches data from the Pokémon API and displays detailed information about the selected Pokémon, including its name, ID, type(s), stats, height, weight, and a sprite image.

Program Features: 
- Users can input a Pokémon name or ID number to retrieve its information. The search bar is user-friendly, with labeled input fields and a clear, accessible design.
- The app dynamically updates to display the Pokémon's name, ID, types, and base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed). The Pokémon's sprite is also displayed, providing a visual reference.
- The layout is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across various devices, from mobile phones to larger desktop screens.
- The program uses unique color schemes for different Pokémon types, enhancing the visual distinction between Pokémon characteristics.
- If a Pokémon is not found, the app alerts the user and resets the display, ensuring a smooth user experience.
